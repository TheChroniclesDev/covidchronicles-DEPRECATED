  <p>
  This is just the beginning of the long, long story that the Covid Chronicles bring us.
  China is currently coping with the first case popping up coming from a wet market.
  Little do the citizens of Wuhan know that the virus is completely uncontained at this point in time.

  December
</h3>
<p>
 As we move into this month, December, China sees the city of Wuhan have cases on the rise.
 People there think it's just another case of the flu spreading around and the Chinese govnerment is trying to cover up what's really happening.
 People continue to travel all over the world including people travelling from Wuhan and other places in China as well.
 Christmas is here and no one from other countries is the wiser on what's happening except doctors and scientists predicting a terrible pandemic like we haven't seen in years.
