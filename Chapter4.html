The "Hoax" of a virus begins to spread throughout America from Washington state all the way to New York.
Cases in New York sky rocket as it becomes the epicenter for the virus in the United States.
Around the rest of the world the virus begins to hit loads of countries in Europe, such as Italy.
The entire country begins to panic as the virus begins to spread faster and faster despite the government saying everything is okay.
Around the middle of the month schools begin to shut down as the virus continues to spread faster and faster.
Soon everyone is ordered inside of their houses where in some states it takes much longer for this to happen than others.
Despite the measures of shutting down everything the spread still continues at a steady rate.
